# :wave: About me

Hi - I am Leon, PhD student and code/data enthusiast (read rookie). I teach and study environmental economics.

## :computer: Coding
I work with large (not big) patent data. For data work I mostly use Python, but being an economist I sometimes resort to Stata for statistical/economtric analysis.

I do like the interactive possibilities that HTML, CSS, JavaScript offer. I aim at utilizing these tools more in the future (for teaching and presentations).

## :bulb: Research

My (PhD) projects are mostly hosted in private GitHub repositories. I am considering moving them out in the open (when the time has come).

## :raising_hand: Contacts and clicky stuff
